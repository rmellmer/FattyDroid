Fatty Droid Android Game

This game was a fun project I wanted to try working on. Note that I didn't use any collision or physics engines. I wanted to see if I could generate the collision code and gravity functionality using simple geometric ideals! You can find this game on the Google Play store at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mellmer.ryan.android

## Background
The purpose of making this game was to get more experience with android applications, and as a personal challenge to try and create my own simple physics engine! It's not the prettiest game out there, but it works!
